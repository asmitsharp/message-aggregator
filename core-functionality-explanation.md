# Core Functionality: Matrix Integration, Multi-Platform Message Reception, and User Authentication

## 1. Matrix Integration

Matrix is an open network for secure, decentralized communication. It will serve as the backbone for your application's messaging system.

### Key Components:
- Matrix Homeserver: Your application will need to run or connect to a Matrix homeserver.
- Matrix Client SDK: Use a Go Matrix client SDK (e.g., `mautrix-go`) to interact with the Matrix network.

### Integration Steps:
1. Set up a Matrix homeserver (e.g., Synapse) or use a hosted solution.
2. Implement Matrix client functionality in your Go backend using a Matrix SDK.
3. Create Matrix rooms for each conversation in your application.
4. Map users in your application to Matrix users.

## 2. Message Reception from Different Platforms

To receive messages from various platforms, you'll need to implement platform-specific integrations.

### General Approach:
1. Implement a separate service for each platform integration.
2. Use webhooks or API polling to receive messages from each platform.
3. Convert incoming messages to a standardized format.
4. Send standardized messages to your Matrix rooms.

### Platform-Specific Integrations:
- Slack: Use Slack's Events API and webhooks.
- Email: Set up an IMAP client to fetch emails.
- WhatsApp: Use the WhatsApp Business API.
- Others: Implement similar approaches for other platforms as needed.

### Message Flow:
1. Message received by platform-specific integration.
2. Message converted to standardized format.
3. Message sent to appropriate Matrix room.
4. Matrix client in your application receives the message.
5. Message stored in your database and made available to users.

## 3. User Login and Signup

Your application needs its own user authentication system, which will then manage connections to various platforms.

### User Signup Process:
1. User provides email, password, and basic info.
2. Create user account in your database.
3. Create corresponding Matrix user account.
4. Send verification email.
5. Upon verification, allow user to start adding platform integrations.

### User Login Process:
1. User provides email and password.
2. Verify credentials against your database.
3. If valid, create a session token.
4. Use Matrix SDK to log in to the user's Matrix account.

### Adding Platform Integrations:
1. User chooses a platform to add (e.g., Slack, Gmail).
2. Redirect user to platform's OAuth flow.
3. Receive OAuth token and store securely.
4. Use token to fetch user's messages and contacts from the platform.
5. Create necessary Matrix rooms for the user's conversations on this platform.

### Session Management:
- Use secure, httpOnly cookies or JWT tokens for session management.
- Implement refresh token mechanism for long-lived sessions.
- Store user's Matrix access token securely for persistent connection.

## 4. Bringing It All Together

### Message Reception and Display:
1. User logs in to your application.
2. Your backend logs in to the user's Matrix account.
3. Matrix client starts syncing, receiving messages from all integrated platforms.
4. New messages are processed, stored in your database, and sent to the frontend.
5. Frontend displays messages in a unified interface, regardless of source platform.

### Sending Messages:
1. User composes a message in your application.
2. Frontend sends message to your backend.
3. Backend determines the destination platform.
4. If Matrix-native, send directly via Matrix.
5. If another platform, use the appropriate API to send the message.
6. Store sent message in your database and update frontend.
